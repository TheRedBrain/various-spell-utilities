# Various Spell Utilities

This mod adds various supporting content, that can be used by data packs and content mods.

It does not add any gameplay content on its own, but gives data pack/mod authors more possibilities to add content.

Including:
- 3 Spell Schools ("Generic Melee", "Generic Ranged", "Generic Magic")
- 1 new entity attribute ("Generic Magic Damage")

These spell schools are very generic on purpose. They are designed to be used together with the mods Spell Engine Extension and Damage Overhaul.
